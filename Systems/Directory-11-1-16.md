##Directories

  A *nix directory is a file containing the names of the files within the directory along with basic information like file type.
  
  Moving files into/out of a directory means changing the directory file, not actually moving any data.
  
  
  opendir - \<dirent.h\>
  
    Open a directory file
    
    This will not change the cwd, it only allows your program to read the contents of the directory file
    
    opendir(\<PATH\>);
    
    Returns a pointer to a directory stream (DIR *)
    
    
  closedir - \<dirent.h\>
  
    Closes the directory stream and frees the pointer associated with it.
    
    closedir (\<DIRECTORY STREAM\>)
    
    
  readdir - \<dirent.h\>
  
    readdir (\<DIRECTORY STREAM\>)
    
    Returns a pointer to the next entry in a directory stream, or NULL if all entries have already been returned.
    
    struct dirent - \<sys.types.h\>
    
      Directory struct that contains the information stored in a directory file.
      
      Some of the data members
      
        d_name: Name of a file
        d_type: File type as an int
