# Aim: Redirection; how does it...SQUIRREL?

## File Redirection
  Changing the usual input/output behavior of a program
  
  Command line redirection
  
  >
  
  Redirects stdout to a file
  
  Overwrites the contents of the file
  
  \<COMMAND\> > \<FILE\>
  
  ls > file_list
  
  
  >>
  
    Redirects stdout to a file by apppending
  
  
  2>
  
    Redirects stderr to a file
  
    Overwrites the file (2>> appends)
  
  
  &>
  
    Redirects stdout and stderr
  
  
  <
  
    Redirects stdin from a file
  
    a.out < filename: sends the contents of filename into a.out
  
  
  | (pipe)
  
    Redirect stdout from one command to stdin of the next
  
    ls | wc :    send output of ls into input of wc
  
  
  
  Redirection in c programs
  
    dup2 - unistd.h
    
    dup2 (fd1, fd2) 
    
      Duplicates the behavior for fd1 at fd2
      
      Redirects fd2 to fd2
      
      You will lose any reference to the original fd2, that file is closed.
  
  
    dup
    
      Duplicates an existing entry in the file table.
      
      Returns a new file descriptor for the duplicate entry.
      
      dup(fd)
        returns the new file descriptor
