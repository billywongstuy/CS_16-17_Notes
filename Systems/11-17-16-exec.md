```c
execlp("ls", "ls","-l",NULL);

char * command[3];
command[0] = "ls";
command[1] = "-l";
command[2] = 0;

execvp(command[0], command);
```



strsep - \<string.h\>

  Used for parsing a string with a common delimiter
  
  strsep (\<SOURCE\>, \<DELIMITER\> )
  
  delimiter is a string with the characters           aka "./!"   parses at '.' , '/', and '!'
  
  Locates the first occurence of any of the specified delimiters in a string and replaces it with a NULL
  
  Returns the beginning of the original string, sets the source string to the string starting
  at 1 index past the location of the new NULL
  
  
  ```c
char line[] = "this-is-a-string";

char *s = line;
char *p;

p = strsep(&s, "-");

//p points to the beginning 
//s goes to the i after the -
//the first - becomes a null

```

```c
char line[100] = "ls -a -l";
char *s = line;
char *command[10];

int i = 0;
while (s) {
  command[i] = strsep(&s, " ");
  i++;
}

execvp(command[0], command);

```
