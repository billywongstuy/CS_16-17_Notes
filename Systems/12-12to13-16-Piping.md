# Aim: Ceci n'est pas une pipe

## Pipe
  * A conduit between 2 separate processes on the same computer.
  
  * Pipes have 2 ends, a read end and a write end.
  
  * Pipes are undirectional (a single pipe must be either read or write only in a process).
  
  * Pipes act just like files.
  
  * You can transfer any data you like through a pipe using read/write.
  
  * Unnamed pipes have no external identification.
  
  * pipe - \<unistd.h\>
  
    * Create an unnamed pipe.
    
    * Returns 0 if the pipe was created, -1 if not.
    
    * Opens both ends of the pipe as files.
    
    * pipe (int descriptors[2])
    
      * descriptors: Array that will contain the descriptors for each end of the pipe.

## Code
```c
#include ...

int main() {
  int fds[2];
  
  pipe(fds);
  
  int f = fork();
  if (f = 0) {
    printf("[child] listening\n");
    close(fds[1]);
    char s[20];
    read(fds[0],s,sizeof(s));
    printf("[child] got: %s\n",s);
  }
  else {
    close(fds[0]);
  
    printf("[parent] sleeping\n");
    sleep(5);
    write(fds[1],"hello there",12);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

## Named Pipes
  * Also known as FIFOs.
  
  * Same as unnamed pipes except FIFOs have a name that can be used to identify them via different programs.
  
  * Like unnamed pipes, FIFOs are undirectional.
  
  * mkfifo
  
    * Shell command to make a FIFO
    
    * $ mkfifo \<pipe name\>
    
  * mkfifo - \<sys.types.h\> , \<sys.stat.h\>
  
    * C function to create a FIFO
    
    * Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure
    
    * Once created, the FIFO acts like a regular file, and we can use open, read, write, and close on it.
    
    * mkfifo ( \<name\>, \<permissions\> )
    
    * FIFOs will block on open until both ends of the pipe have a connection.
    
    
## Code
```c
#include ...

int main() {
  mkfifo("mario",0644);
  
  int fd = open("mario",O_WRONLY);
  printf("connected\n");
  
  write(fd,"hello there\n",13);
  
  return 0;
}
```
