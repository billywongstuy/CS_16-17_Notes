#Aim: Ceci n'est pas une pipe

##Pipe
  A conduit between 2 separate processes on the same computer.
  
  Pipes have 2 ends, a read end and a write end.
  
  Pipes are undirectional (a single pipe must be either read or write only in a process).
  
  Pipes act just like files.
  
  You can transfer any data you like through a pipe using read/write.
  
  Unnamed pipes have no external identification.
  
  pipe - \<unistd.h\>
  
    Create an unnamed pipe.
    
    Returns 0 if the pipe was created, -1 if not.
    
    Opens both ends of the pipe as files.
    
    pipe (int descriptors[2])
    
      descriptors: Array that will contain the descriptors for each end of the pipe.
      
      
```c
#include ...

int main() {
  int fds[2];
  
  pipe(fds);
  
  int f = fork();
  if (f = 0) {
    printf("[child] listening\n");
    close(fds[1]);
    char s[20];
    read(fds[0],s,sizeof(s));
    printf("[child] got: %s\n",s);
  }
  else {
    close(fds[0]);
  
    printf("[parent] sleeping\n");
    sleep(5);
    write(fds[1],"hello there",12);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
