#Aim: What the fork?

fork() - \<unistd.h\>

  Creates a separate process based on the current one, the new process is called the child,
  the original is the parent
  
  The child process is a duplicate of the parent process. All parts of the parent process are
  copied, including stack and heap memory, and the file table.
  
  Returns 0 to the child and the child's pid to the parent or -1 (errno).
  
  If a parent process ends before the child, the child's new parent pid is 1.
