D/N: What do you know anout the origins of the WWW?

A bit of history...


HTML was not designed to handle formatting, but rather to describe content.

ie,

<h1> this is a heading </h1>

<h2> this is a different type of heading </h2>

<p> this is a paragraph </p>


Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

Created to separate presentation of an html/xml from its content.

[some css notes]

[inline style=""]

[out of line <style></style>]
