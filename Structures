##Aim: Structured programming


#Struct

  A collection of values in a single data type
  
  ```c 
  struct{int a; char x;} s; 
  ```
  
    Here, s is a variable of type struct {int a; char x;}

  ```c
  struct foo {int x; char a;];  //makes a prototype struct called foo with an int and a char 
  struct foo s;
  s.x = 12345;
  printf("s.x: %d\n",s.x);
  ```
  
  
  ```c
  struct foo {int x; char a;];
  struct foo *s;
  s = (struct foo *)malloc(sizeof(struct foo));
  
  s->x;     //equivalent to   (*s).x;
  ```
  
  
  ##Code
  '''c
  struct {int a; char x;} s;
  printf("size of s: %lu\n", sizeof(s));
  
  '''
